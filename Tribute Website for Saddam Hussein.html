<h2> Fifth President of Iraq</h2>
    <p>
<b>Saddam Hussein</b> was the fifth President of Iraq, ruling from 1979 until 2003. He belonged to the Ba'ath Party, which emphasized Arab unity and socialism. Under his rule, Iraq saw significant modernization, but also harsh repression and long warsâ€”especially the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War. He was captured by U.S. forces in 2003 and executed in 2006 after a controversial trial.</p>
